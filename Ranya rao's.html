<p><a href="file:///C:/Users/muru/Desktop/India%20today/Gold%20smug.html">Gold smuggling accused Ranya Raoâ€™s </a> stepfather, Ramchandra Rao, a DGP-rank officer in Karnataka, was sent on compulsory leave on Saturday. The IPS officer currently serves as the Managing Director of the Karnataka State Police Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation.

Ranya Rao was <a href="file:///C:/Users/muru/Desktop/India%20today/Arrested%20march%203.html">arrested at Bengaluru Airport on March 3 </a> with 14.2 kg of gold worth Rs 12.56 crore while returning from Dubai. The Protocol Officer who assisted the actor had told investigating officers that he had done so <a href="file:///C:/Users/muru/Desktop/India%20today/specific%20instru.html"> under specific instructions </a> from DGP Rao.</p>
<p>The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), which is investigating the case, informed the special court on Friday that the probe has so far uncovered a "sophisticated methodology" for gold smuggling, using the State Police Protocol Officer to bypass security, engaging in hawala transactions to transfer funds from India to Dubai for purchasing gold, and the involvement of a larger syndicate.</p>
<p>Responding to his daughter's arrest earlier, the <a href="file:///C:/Users/muru/Desktop/India%20today/IPS%20officer.html">IPS officer had distanced himself from her actions </a> and said he was a "heartbroken parent". He claimed he was unaware of her alleged involvement in smuggling activities, learning about her arrest only through media reports, as she had been living separately after her recent marriage.

However, the constable stationed at Kempegowda Airport Police Station, who was serving as a protocol officer, told DRI officials that he was merely following direct orders from Ramachandra Rao. He said that his duties involved facilitating the smooth arrival and departure of Ranya Rao <a href="file:///C:/Users/muru/Desktop/India%20today/instruction.html"> based on instructions from senior officials </a>.</p>
